I am a Master of Mathematics (MMath) student in Computer Science at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca), working as part of the [Cryptography, Security, and Privacy (CrySP)](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca) lab under the supervision of [Prof. Florian Kerschbaum](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~fkerschb/).

My primary research interests lie in the Security, Privacy, and Safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Computer Vision Models. Currently, I investigate the robustness and reliability of automated methods for detecting machine-generated text (e.g. outputs from LLMs).
